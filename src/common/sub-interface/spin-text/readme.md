# Spin Text

These files contain reusable text strings for loading spinners with the [ora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora-classic) library. A text string is only defined here if it is used multiple times by different tasks. Otherwise, it will be found within the 'ora' object itself.

These strings have been sorted into groups for easier readability based on function. For example, [st-parse.js](./st-parse.js) is for loading spinners related to input parsing.
