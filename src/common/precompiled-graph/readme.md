# Precompiled Graph

These files contain the definition code for a hard-coded graph object for use with the [test-export](../../../info/commands/test-export.md) command. This is so that the command can create export files based on already completed data rather than having to rely on external input.

This data is based on the [absolute example](../../../examples/absolute/input.txt) so this graph object is based on real data.
