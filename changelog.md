# Changelog

**./templates/web-output/f-graph.js**
* Added style selectors which colour nodes based on their type.
	* The default Blue colour has already been specified.
	* Start = Green
	* Finish = Red
	* Blocked = Grey
* The colours themselves are unchanged but objects are coloured as part of graph styling and not part of the node object itself.
